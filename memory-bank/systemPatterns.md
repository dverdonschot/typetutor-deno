# System Patterns

This file documents significant architectural and system design patterns used in
the Typetutor project.

- Initial pattern: Component-based UI (Preact/React).
- Initial pattern: Hook-based state management (`useQuoteInput`,
  `useTypingMetrics`).
- Initial pattern: Content fetching from static files (`fetchContentFromUrl`).
