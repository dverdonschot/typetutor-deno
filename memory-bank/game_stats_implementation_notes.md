# Game Statistics Implementation Notes

**Date:** 2025-05-25

**Goal:** Implement in-memory tracking and nested visualization of game statistics (finished) for different game types (alphabet, quotes, code, random).

**Update:** The implementation plan has been revised to only track and visualize finished game statistics. 

**Files Modified:**
- `utils/gameStats.ts`: Updated data structure to support nested categories.
- `routes/api/game-stats.ts`: Modified POST handler to handle optional `category` and update nested counts. Added GET handler to return stats.
- `islands/RandomSettings.tsx`: Added `gameType="random"` and `category` prop to `<KeyLogger />`.
- `islands/QuoteTyperMode.tsx`: Added logic to send `category` (from `selectedContentItem.category`) with stats when `contentType` is "quote". Added default `contentType` of "other".
- `islands/StatsPage.tsx`: Modified rendering logic to display nested statistics.
- `routes/stats.tsx`: Created a minimal route to render the `StatsPage` island.

**Current State:**
- In-memory statistics storage with nested categories is implemented.
- API endpoint can receive and store statistics with optional categories.
- Alphabet, Quote, and Code game types are intended to send statistics with correct types/categories.
- Random game type is intended to send "random" as gameType and character set name as category.
- Stats page displays nested structure.

**Outstanding Issue:**
- Random game type is still appearing as "undefined" on the stats page.

**Potential Areas for Further Investigation:**
- Verify how the random game mode specifically determines and passes the character set name as the category.
- Double-check the logic in `islands/RandomSettings.tsx` for deriving the category name.
- Ensure the `KeyLogger` component correctly receives and uses the `gameType` and `category` props when called from `islands/RandomSettings.tsx`.
