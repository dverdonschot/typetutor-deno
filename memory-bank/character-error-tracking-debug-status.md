# Character Error Tracking Debug Status

## Current Issue
Despite implementing character error tracking in both `useQuoteInput` and `useMobileInput` hooks, the system still shows "Perfect! No character errors in this game" even when there are clearly mistakes (20 mistakes, 0% accuracy).

## What We've Implemented âœ…

### 1. Type Definitions Updated
- `types/userStats.ts`: Added `GameWrongCharacterData` interface
- Replaced `wrongKeys` with `wrongCharacters` in `DetailedGameResult`
- Added `characterErrorStats` to `UserStatsData`

### 2. useQuoteInput Hook âœ…
- Added `wrongCharactersInGame` Map to track character errors
- Added character error tracking logic in the main loop
- Added `getWrongCharactersArray()` function
- Added debug logging: `Character error tracked: expected "..." at position ...`

### 3. useMobileInput Hook âœ…
- Added `wrongCharactersInGame` Map to state interface
- Added character error tracking in the correctness check loop
- Added `getWrongCharactersArray()` function
- Added debug logging: `Character error tracked (mobile): expected "..." at position ...`

### 4. Components Updated âœ…
- `QuoteTyperMode.tsx`: Uses `getWrongCharactersArray()`
- `TrigraphsTyperMode.tsx`: Uses `getWrongCharactersArray()`
- `KeyLogger.tsx`: Uses `getWrongCharactersArray()` from `useMobileInput`

### 5. Display Components âœ…
- `GameScoreDisplayIsland.tsx`: Shows character errors instead of keyboard heatmap
- `UserStatsIsland.tsx`: Added character error statistics display

## Current Problem ðŸš¨

**User typed**: `FrfufL7fjfFfrfyfg%fJf5mfnfFyfF75fJ` (with 20 mistakes, 0% accuracy)  
**Result**: Still shows "Perfect! No character errors in this game"

## Debugging Steps for Tomorrow

### 1. Check Browser Console
**Look for these debug messages:**
- `Character error tracked (mobile): expected "..." at position ...`
- `getWrongCharactersArray called (mobile), returning ... wrong characters`

**If no debug messages appear:**
- The character error tracking logic is not being executed
- Need to check if `useMobileInput` is being called correctly

### 2. Verify useMobileInput Integration
**Check if:**
- The `wrongCharactersInGame` Map is being initialized properly
- The character comparison logic is working: `targetChar.char === typedChar`
- The error tracking condition is being met

### 3. Debug the Character Comparison Logic
**In `useMobileInput.ts` around line 99-124:**
```typescript
if (targetChar.char === typedChar) {
  targetChar.state = "correct";
  newCorrectCount++;
} else {
  targetChar.state = "incorrect";
  newMistakeCount++;
  // Character error tracking should happen here
}
```

### 4. Check Game Completion Logic
**In `KeyLogger.tsx`:**
- Verify `getWrongCharactersArray()` is called when game completes
- Check if the game result is being passed correctly to `GameScoreDisplayIsland`

### 5. Potential Issues to Investigate

1. **Timing Issue**: Character errors might be tracked but then cleared before game completion
2. **State Management**: The `wrongCharactersInGame` Map might not be persisting between renders
3. **Component Issue**: The `GameScoreDisplayIsland` might not be receiving the correct game result
4. **Logic Error**: The character comparison might have edge cases we're missing

## Files Modified
- `hooks/useMobileInput.ts` - Added character error tracking
- `hooks/useQuoteInput.ts` - Added character error tracking  
- `islands/KeyLogger.tsx` - Updated to use character error tracking
- `islands/GameScoreDisplayIsland.tsx` - Updated to display character errors
- `types/userStats.ts` - Updated type definitions
- `utils/userStatsManager.ts` - Added character error statistics

## Next Session Plan
1. Open browser console and test typing with errors
2. Add more debug logging if needed
3. Step through the character comparison logic
4. Verify the game result is being passed correctly
5. Fix any issues found in the debugging process

The implementation is mostly complete - we just need to debug why the character error tracking isn't working as expected.
