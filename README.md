# Typetutor Deno

Typetutor is a app I have developed in a few languages to learn how to code. The
goal is a program to learn touch typing with for example random characters,
quotes or the alphabet.

Last time I made a CLI app in Rust (and python), now I want to try the best
Typescript has to offer with Deno and Fresh.

- [Deno](https://deno.com/) is a JavaScript runtime in Typescript.
- [Fresh web framework](https://fresh.deno.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com)

Your new Fresh project is ready to go. You can follow the Fresh "Getting
Started" guide here: https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
